# Heartbeat Task

Manages recurring tasks in HEARTBEAT.md — the agent's standing instruction file. The heartbeat service checks this file at a regular interval and executes the most overdue task each cycle.

## When to Fire

Fire this skill whenever the user describes something that should happen regularly. Listen for:

**Add a task when the user says:**
- "Remind me to check X every morning"
- "Every Monday, review the sprint board"
- "Check my email every 4 hours"
- "Run the test suite daily at 9am"
- "Keep an eye on the deployment pipeline"
- "Weekly, summarize what happened this week"
- Any instruction with time-based recurrence (every, daily, weekly, hourly, morning, evening)

**Update a task when:**
- The user changes the cadence ("make that every 2 hours instead")
- The user refines what the task should do
- The user changes the time window

**Remove a task when:**
- The user says "stop checking...", "cancel the...", "remove the..."
- A task is no longer relevant

## Setup Workflow — Follow Every Time

When creating a new recurring task, always walk through these steps in order. Do not skip any.

### 1. Clarify the Task

Make sure you understand exactly what should happen:
- What is being checked, queried, or produced?
- What service or API is involved (if any)?
- How often should it run?
- Should it only run during certain hours?

If anything is ambiguous, ask the user before proceeding.

### 2. Resolve Notification Delivery

Ask the user: **"Where do you want to receive the results?"**

Options to present:
- **Push notification** — send via `kyberbot notify "..."`, which routes through the channel configured in `identity.yaml` (`notification_channel`, default `whatsapp`) and automatically falls back to the other channel if the primary is disconnected. This is the default for anything user-facing.
- **Brain only** — store in memory, viewable via `kyberbot recall` / `kyberbot timeline` (silent, no notification)
- **Brain file** — write results to a file in `brain/` for later review
- **Other** — the user may want Slack, email, Notion, etc. — this may require creating an integration

Read identity.yaml to check which channels are configured before offering push notifications. If neither WhatsApp nor Telegram is set up, don't offer the push option — guide the user to add a channel first (`kyberbot channel add whatsapp` or `kyberbot channel add telegram`).

### 3. Resolve Credentials & Dependencies

If the task requires API access:
- Check if the needed API key / token is already in `.env`
- If not, walk the user through getting it (where to find it, what permissions it needs)
- Store it in `.env` (tell the user what you're adding)
- Note the env var name — the skill will reference it

If the task requires a CLI tool, package, or external service:
- Check if it's available
- Walk through installation if needed

### 4. Create a Skill (for non-trivial tasks)

If the task involves more than a single simple command (API calls, parsing output, conditional notifications), create a dedicated skill:

1. Create `skills/<task-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Include the full step-by-step execution instructions
3. Include the notification delivery method chosen in step 2
4. Reference env vars by name (e.g., `$POSTHOG_API_KEY`), never hardcode secrets
5. For push delivery, use `kyberbot notify "<message>"` — never hardcode bot tokens, chat IDs, or JIDs in skill files. The notify command resolves the destination from `identity.yaml` at execution time, so the user can switch channels by editing one config field.

### 5. Register the Heartbeat Task

Add the task to HEARTBEAT.md using the format below. If you created a skill in step 4, include the `**Skill**` reference.

### 6. Test It

Run the task once manually to verify it works:
- If you created a skill, follow its instructions step by step
- Verify the API call succeeds
- Verify the notification is delivered to the right place
- Fix any issues before confirming to the user

### 7. Confirm to the User

Tell the user:
- What task was created and its schedule
- Where results will be delivered
- That it's been tested and is working
- How to check on it later (`kyberbot heartbeat status`)

## HEARTBEAT.md Format

Tasks in HEARTBEAT.md follow this exact structure:

```markdown
### Task Name
**Schedule**: every 4h / daily 9am / weekly Monday / every 30m
**Window**: 09:00-17:00 (optional — restricts execution to these hours)
**Action**: What the agent should do — written as a clear instruction
**Skill**: skill-name (optional — references a skill in skills/ with detailed execution steps)
```

The schedule field uses natural language that the heartbeat parser understands:
- `every 30m` / `every 2h` / `every 4h` — interval-based
- `daily 9am` / `daily` — once per day
- `weekly Monday` / `weekly` — once per week

The window field is optional — omit it if the task can run anytime during active hours.

The **Skill** field is optional. When present, the heartbeat service automatically loads the full skill content from `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and injects it into the execution prompt. Use this when a task requires detailed, multi-step instructions that would be too verbose for the Action field alone.

## Examples

**Simple task (no skill needed):**
```markdown
### Review Todo List
**Schedule**: every 4h
**Window**: 09:00-18:00
**Action**: Read the current todo list and surface any items that are overdue or due soon. Remind the user of top priorities.
```

**Complex task with skill and push delivery:**
```markdown
### PostHog Signup Check
**Schedule**: every 30m
**Action**: Check for new signups and notify via `kyberbot notify` if any found.
**Skill**: posthog-signups
```

**Task with brain-only storage:**
```markdown
### Weekly Summary
**Schedule**: weekly Friday
**Action**: Query the timeline for this week's events with `kyberbot timeline --week`. Summarize key decisions, people met, and progress made. Write the summary to brain/weekly-summaries/.
```

## Notes

- The heartbeat service runs the most overdue task each cycle — it doesn't run all tasks at once.
- Tasks should be written as instructions the agent can execute autonomously, without user input.
- Keep actions specific. "Check email" is vague. "Run `command` and summarize new items" is actionable.
- The heartbeat respects active hours configured in identity.yaml — tasks won't run outside those hours regardless of their schedule.
- For push delivery: always go through `kyberbot notify "<message>"` (optionally `--channel telegram|whatsapp` to override). The command reads `notification_channel` from identity.yaml, resolves the right target, and handles channel fallback. Never write Telegram curl calls or Baileys send calls directly in skill files.
