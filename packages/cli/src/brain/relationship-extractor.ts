const EXTRACTION_PROMPT = `You are an entity relationship extractor. Analyze the conversation text and extract:

1. **Entities**: People, companies, projects, places, and topics mentioned
2. **Relationships**: Explicit relationships between entities

## Entity Types
- person: Individual people (e.g., "John", "Dr. Smith", "my brother")
- company: Companies, organizations (e.g., "Google", "Acme Corp", "the university")
- project: Specific named projects, products, or apps that someone is building or working on (e.g., "KyberBot", "Project Alpha", "the mobile app"). NOTE: Programming languages, frameworks, libraries, databases, and tools are NOT projects — classify them as topic instead.
- place: Locations (e.g., "New York", "the office", "Thailand")
- topic: Topics, concepts, technologies, tools, frameworks, programming languages (e.g., "AI", "funding", "TypeScript", "Docker", "React", "SQLite", "Express", "deployment")

## Relationship Types (only use these exact values)
- founded: Person founded company/project
- works_at: Person works at company
- invested_in: Person/company invested in company/project
- met_with: Person met with person
- created: Person created project
- manages: Person manages project/company
- partners_with: Company partners with company
- located_in: Company/project located in place
- discussed: Entities discussed together (topic-related)
- related_to: Generic relationship when specific type unclear
- reports_to: Person reports to person (management hierarchy)
- uses: Project/company uses a technology or tool (topic)
- depends_on: Project depends on another project or technology
- part_of: Entity is part of a larger entity (team part of company, module part of project)

## Rules
- Only extract relationships that are EXPLICITLY stated or strongly implied
- Do NOT create relationships just because entities appear together
- Do NOT extract shell commands (curl, bash, git), file paths (.claude/settings.json), error messages (BLOCKED, timeout), or infrastructure noise (sandbox, permissions, max turns limit) as entities
- The speaker is "user" unless otherwise specified
- Set confidence 0.8-0.95 for explicit statements, 0.5-0.7 for implied relationships
- Provide brief rationale explaining why you identified each relationship

Respond with JSON only:
{
  "entities": [
    { "name": "John Smith", "type": "person" },
    { "name": "Acme Corp", "type": "company" }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source": { "name": "John Smith", "type": "person" },
      "target": { "name": "Acme Corp", "type": "company" },
      "relationship": "founded",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "rationale": "Text explicitly states John founded Acme Corp"
    }
  ]
}

If no explicit relationships found, return empty relationships array but still list entities.`;
